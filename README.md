# 70sCrush
Bell-bottoms, disco balls, disco-goers doing the "hustle" dance, afros with hair picks, sport shorts, TVs with wires, 70s cars, Star Wars character toys, lunch boxes, Farrah Fawcett hair, bowl cuts, records, kung fu movie references, etc.

Achievement sayings: "Dynamite, you're a bad mutha...shut your mouth. What? I'm just talking about [the player's name], my brotha, hit me on the black hand side, etc."

Opening/closing: TV cards with colored bars - "Your broadcast will commence shortly" / "Goodnight, your broadcast will continue tomorrow."

Achievement music: (Rocky reaching the top of the stairs), open to direction 

I want the game to transport kids of the 70s back to their beloved time, while evoking nostalgia for the generation that remembers it. I aim to open the 70s era to those who love that time in America through a fun game that might become a conversation starter for generations.

I plan to create the UI design with a faux wood look of televisions, using those warm colors of the 70s. I've got to start learning to use Figma for this purpose.

Thank you for understanding my vision. I am learning to code, and this is my second project ever! I'm challenging myself, and any help from you masters is welcomed. Honestly any experienced individuals help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you again <3!
